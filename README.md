## Domain Driven Design With Golang
* DDD is a development approach where domain is in the core of the application. Domain the actual or real world use case that needs to be modeled. The system follows ddd considered to represent the real world system.

* It's always recommended engineers discuss about the core domain with the business analysts or business teams to understand domain as well as subdomains which would help engineering teams to model the domain.

* Let's take an example of authentication/authorization service, in this case our core domain would be `User` related data such as `username`, `password`, `emailId` etc that we want to store and use in the application and ultimately in the business.
